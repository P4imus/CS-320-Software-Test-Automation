How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  The first step to ensuring that my code is functional and secure is by being careful during the development step. By taking the time to write the code the right way I will decrease the amount of mistakes I will have to fix later on in the project. Next is to test the code with multiple techniques to thoroughly test it. Techniques such as module testing, integration testing, static, and others depending on the purpose of the code.
  
  How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  
   When I start a new project I will look at the requirements and separate the list into bigger functions. From there I look to see what I will need to make those functions work properly and see if any of the requirements overlap. Then I start working on the code starting from the basic functions and work my way up. During the development I will refer to my notes and the requirements page often.
    
  How do I approach designing software?
    
   Currently I approach designing software knowing that I have a lot to learn. Knowing this I am very careful when reviewing my code for errors and I always look to see if I can make it less complicated. In the future I hope to have a higher level of confidence when designing software.
